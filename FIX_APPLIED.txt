✅ FIXED: Lemon Squeezy Checkout 422 Error
==========================================

Incorrect API format for checkout_options in Lemon Squeezy API

WRONG FORMAT (was):
{
  "checkout_options": {
    "redirect_url": "https://www.hazlabel.co/checkout/success"
  }
}

CORRECT FORMAT (now):
{
  "checkout_options": {
    "redirect": {
      "url": "https://www.hazlabel.co/checkout/success"
    }
  }
}

NEXT STEPS:
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (~2 minutes)
2. Test checkout from: https://www.hazlabel.co/pricing
3. Click "Subscribe" on Professional plan
